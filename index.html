            Welcome to the class! My name is Shane Panter and I will be your instructor for
            this course. For many students, this will be the first time you have been exposed
            to web development topics. This course has been designed to take someone who has
            never seen these concepts before to being able to produce relatively complex programs
            in 16 weeks. This class is a three credit course, and it is specifically designed
            to require 8 to 10 hours of work each week. In order to succeed in the course, it
            will be critical for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with the reading
            and lab activities. Please take some time to get familiar with the course website. Pay
            close attention to when the homework assignments are due to ensure you get everything
            in on time. <br>We will be interacting with each other primarily through GitHub,
            discussion forums, and videos. Get started by completing the Course Introduction homework below!

    <h1>Class Coding Standards</h1>
    <h2 id="overview">
        Overview <a href="#overview">#</a>
    </h2>

    <p>This document applies to all coding labs turned in during the semester. You are expected to follow
        these standards for all the code that you submit.</p>

    <h2 id="compiling-and-running-code">
        Compiling and Running Code <a href="#compiling-and-running-code">#</a>
    </h2>


    <p>Unless otherwise stated, all code must compile and run on the department’s computers in the <a
            href="https://cs481.boisestate.edu/ccp-tour/index.html">Kount
        Computer Lab (CCP241)</a>. It doesn’t matter if your
        code compiles on your machine, it must compile on the computers provided in CCP241. If your program
        fails to compile, it will be awarded 0 points. Absolutely no partial credit will be given if your
        program does not compile.</p>

    <p>You can access the lab computers remotely via ssh or you can go to the lab and use a workstation
        directly.</p>


    <h2 id="spelling-and-grammar">

        Spelling and Grammar <a href="#spelling-and-grammar">#</a>

    </h2>


    <p>I generally do not care about spelling or grammar mistakes. The only exception to this rule is if
        your spelling and grammar are so bad I literally can’t make heads or tails of what you are trying to
        say. You can install a <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">spell
            checker</a>
        that works with <strong>camelCase</strong> code!</p>

    <h2 id="artistic-license">
        Artistic License <a href="#artistic-license">#</a>
    </h2>


    <p>Your programming labs and homework have been carefully crafted to ensure certain <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XZJ_oXxTwgnL0vkrBdRjkDB50WlsOPhKUcu-gsZb25o/edit?usp=sharing">learning
        objectives</a> are satisfied. Thus you are required to
        solve the problem as described in the lab write up. For example, if a lab asks you to solve a
        problem using CSS and you think using Javascript is a better solution you have defeated the
        purpose of the lab and you will receive 0 points for your work regardless if you got the correct
        output.</p>
